<h1> Hi! I'm Quinn Rouse </h1>
I'm a junior in at Purdue University pursuing degrees in both Computer Science and Philosophy. I'm very interested in software development, especially software that intersects with the financial services world. I'm looking forward to hopefully gaining more software development experience at an internship this summer.
